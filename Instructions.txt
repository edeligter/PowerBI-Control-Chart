Instructions:
1. Select SampleData.xlsx and use GetData to import into PowerBI
2. Select X for Category Data
3. Select Y for Measured Data
4. Select Subgroup for Subgroup Column
5. Select required standard deviation and Moving Range from Statistics menu

NB: The Subgroup column is normally a non-aggregated column that is used to define the Subgrouping.


The SampleData2.xlsx in the root folder is a much larger dataset (>8000 records) and uses Date as the Category Data. To try that dataset, use Grade as the Stage Column and MXMDosage as the MeasuredData. Add a Slicer visual to filter the grades and another slicer to filter dates.
